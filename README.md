## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset, which contains information on various features like median income, average rooms per house, and population, among others. The target variable is the median house value.

## Project Structure

- `ML_Assignment_3-Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the regression models.
- `README.md`: Documentation file for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries and their versions.

## Regression Algorithms

The following regression algorithms have been implemented:

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. Gradient Boosting Regressor
5. Support Vector Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²) Score

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/california-housing-regression.git
   cd california-housing-regression
